# Financial IDE Frontend

## What is this Repo?

This repository will deal with the IDE and the Forecasting part of Frontend.\
All the changes and commits regarding those will be made here.

## What about Goalcasting?

The development for the Goalcasting part will be handled in another repository.\
This project is setup in a way that it will allow parallel development of both the IDE/Forecasting and Goalcasting.\
It makes sure that whenever a new module is added by a person, it won't affect the progress of the other person.\
The motivation for this is easy integration of the two different parts of the frontend without introducing conflicts.\
Another motivation is to keep both parts organized and open to changes without being dependent/coupled to each other.
